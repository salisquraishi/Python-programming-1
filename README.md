Some basic python programming exercises from following repository.

[Python-programming-exercises](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises)

## About
All excercises are inside codes directory. Each file is a separate program and problem statements are put up as initial comments. 

I have created a 'q_scanner.py' which scans all 'programs\*' files, reads top comments and appends them as a question in a 'problems.txt' file.
